# Configuring Releases: Depreciation, Prepayments, Deferred Revenue

Accounting releases control how and when transactions are recognized in your ledger. Light provides a flexible release framework for managing depreciation, prepayments, deferred revenue, and other amortized items across your organization.

## Understanding accounting releases

An accounting release is a rule that breaks down a single transaction into multiple ledger entries across time. Rather than recording an amount entirely in one period, releases spread recognition according to a defined schedule.

Release templates define the pattern. When you apply a template to an invoice line, Light automatically generates the corresponding ledger entries across the specified period, posting them on their scheduled dates.

## Release template components

Each release template includes:

**Duration and period**: The length of time over which the release occurs and how frequently entries post. A 12-month template with monthly releases creates 12 individual ledger entries.

**Release pattern**: How the amount is distributed. Light supports straight-line (equal portions each period), declining balance, and custom allocation patterns.

**Balance sheet account (Contra account)**: The release template requires a **balance sheet account** — this is where the full amount is initially parked. For prepayments, this would be a prepaid asset account; for depreciation, a fixed asset account; for deferred revenue, a deferred revenue liability account. When you apply the template to a transaction line, Light automatically moves the entire amount to this balance sheet account and releases it to the expense/revenue account over time.

**Currency handling**: Specify whether releases use the transaction currency, local entity currency, or group currency for each posting.

## Setting up deferred revenue releases

Deferred revenue (also called unearned revenue) occurs when you receive payment before delivering goods or services. Create a release template by:

1. Navigate to **Accounting > Releases** (in Platform section)
2. Click **Create New Template**
3. Enter a template name (e.g., "12-Month Deferred Revenue")
4. Set **Release Type** to **Deferred Revenue**
5. Define the duration (12 months for annual contracts)
6. Select **Straight-line** for monthly recognition
7. Map the deferred revenue liability account and revenue recognition account
8. Save the template

> Tip: Use descriptive template names that include the duration and purpose, such as "24-Month SaaS Deferred Revenue" or "3-Year Prepaid Maintenance".

## Setting up prepayment releases

Prepayments are amounts paid for future goods or services not yet delivered. Create a prepayment release template similarly:

1. Navigate to **Accounting > Releases** (in Platform section)
2. Click **Create New Template**
3. Enter a template name (e.g., "Annual Prepaid Expenses")
4. Set **Release Type** to **Prepayment**
5. Define the recognition period
6. Map the prepaid asset account to the corresponding expense account
7. Save the template

## Setting up depreciation releases

Fixed assets lose value over time through use and obsolescence. Depreciation templates allocate this loss systematically:

1. Navigate to **Accounting > Releases** (in Platform section)
2. Click **Create New Template**
3. Enter a template name (e.g., "5-Year Straight-Line Depreciation")
4. Set **Release Type** to **Depreciation**
5. Define the useful life (5 years = 60 months)
6. Select depreciation method:
   - **Straight-line**: Equal depreciation each period
   - **Declining balance**: Higher depreciation early, lower later
   - **Units of production**: Based on usage
7. Map the fixed asset account to the accumulated depreciation and depreciation expense accounts
8. Save the template

## Applying releases to transactions

Once templates are configured, apply them when entering transactions:

1. Create a new AP, AR, or JE document
2. On each line, select the **expense account** (or revenue account) as the GL account — this is where the amount will ultimately be recognized
3. Select the appropriate release template
4. Specify the start and end dates for the release

**How it works:** When you post the transaction, Light automatically moves the entire amount to the **balance sheet account** configured in the template. The release engine then systematically releases the amount from the balance sheet account to your selected expense/revenue account according to the template schedule.

> Important: You do not need to manually book to the balance sheet account. Pick the expense account on the line, assign the template, and Light handles the rest.

## Example: Depreciating office furniture

This example shows how to record a $12,000 office furniture purchase with a 5-year useful life and no salvage value.

**Step 1: Ensure your release template exists**

Your organization should have a release template called "Furniture" configured with:
- **Release Type**: Accounts Payables
- **Duration**: 60 months (5 years)
- **Pattern**: Straight-line
- **Balance sheet account**: 800800 - Furniture and Assets (this is where the full amount is parked before being released)

**Step 2: Enter the bill**

Navigate to **Spend management → Bills** and click **+ Create bill**. On the bill line item:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Description | Office furniture |
| Amount | $12,000 |
| GL Account | 500500 - Office Furniture (expense account) |
| Release Template | Furniture |

**What happens when you post this bill:**

1. Light creates the accounts payable liability for $12,000
2. The release template immediately capitalizes the expense to the asset account (800800 - Furniture and Assets)
3. Each month, Light automatically posts $200 in depreciation expense (12,000 ÷ 60 months)
4. After 60 months, the asset is fully depreciated with a book value of $0

**The accounting entries:**

*Initial posting (when bill is posted):*
- Debit: 800800 - Furniture and Assets $12,000 (asset)
- Credit: Accounts Payable $12,000 (liability)

*Monthly release (repeated 60 times):*
- Debit: 500500 - Office Furniture $200 (expense)
- Credit: 800800 - Furniture and Assets $200 (contra asset)

> Key concept: On the bill line, you select the **expense account** (500500) as the GL account. The release template's **balance sheet account** (800800) is where Light automatically parks the full amount. The engine then releases from the balance sheet account to your expense account over the 60-month period — you don't need to manually book to the asset account.

## Monitoring and adjusting releases

View active releases in the **Accounting > Releases** dashboard (in Platform section). This shows all pending and completed releases, their progress, and book values. You can:

- View the release schedule and book value chart
- Adjust the end date or amount (adjustments create new release entries)
- Monitor progress as a percentage of the total release period
- Print release schedules for audit documentation

> Good to know: Once a release has posted entries, you cannot delete it. Instead, create an adjustment release to correct errors or changes.

## Multi-entity release management

For multinational organizations, release templates are defined at the company level but can be customized per entity. This allows:

- Consistent release policies across all subsidiaries
- Entity-specific depreciation methods required by local regulations
- Centralized template governance with local flexibility
